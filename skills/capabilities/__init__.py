"""
Capability Registry
===================
All capability modules are registered here.

To add a new capability:
  1. Create skills/capabilities/your_capability.py
     (must define CAPABILITY_ID, DESCRIPTION, KEY_COLUMNS_SUMMARY, format_prompt())
  2. Import and add it to REGISTRY below.
  3. Add binding keys to config/project_N.CAPABILITIES["your_capability"].
  4. Add keyword list to config/project_N.KEYWORDS["your_capability"].
  5. Add "your_capability" to config/project_N.SKILL_PRIORITY at the right position.
  6. Document in docs/SKILLS.md.

That's it. No changes to foundry.py or views/chat.py.
